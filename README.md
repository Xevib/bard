# Changewithin

*Daily emails of changes to buildings and addresses on OpenStreetMap.*

changewithin is a simple script that pulls [daily changes](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/)
from OpenStreetMap with `requests`, parses them with `pyosmium`, finds the ones that are inside
of a GeoJSON shape, sorts out the ones that are buildings, and emails a set of users
with [mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/).

The one file that will require editing is [config.ini](https://github.com/migurski/changewithin/blob/master/config.ini).

At the top you will find a simple list of email addresses to which the script
will send reports. The email templates for both html and text can be edited within
the file `lib.py`. The report itself contains a summary of changes, then lists
each relevant changeset, its ID, and further details. These include the user who
made the change and their comment, individual element IDs for building footprint
and address changes that link to their history, and a map thumbnail that is centered
on the location where the edits were made.
